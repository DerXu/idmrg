Description:
-----------

Python implementation of idmrg code, see idmrg.py for more information.

It is written in Python 2 and is built on numpy/scipy and the modules
contained in the directory my_package. It contains also two other
scripts EE_vs_D.py and corr.py to analyse the data and computing
observables. More documentation to come.

New models can be added as files in my_package. Currently supported
quantum Hamiltonians are: transverse field Ising, XXZ, XXX spin 1,
quantum group invariant XXZ (RXXZ).

Run the code:
-------------

E.g.: run code for Ising quantum chain with parameters in
config/test_Ising.

python idmrg.py -f config/test_Ising

Compute MPS transfer matrix spectrum, entanglement entropy and energy:

python EE_vs_D.py

Compute correlation functions

python corr.py -D 20

where 20 is the auxiliary dimension specified in config/test_Ising.

Version and testing:
